Primary-Flight-Display-PFD-
===========================

PFD simulator widget of an airplane cockpit. This is very much similar to those found in actual cockpits

Simulate a Primary Flight Display or PFD system of an airplane cockpit

*.exe is attached. Download the entire project as a zip and then run the jar, 
only downloading and running the jar will result in the program not working correctly

-PFD is one of the many navigation systems found in the cockpits of almost all aircrafts

-It's main functions are to measure the: aircraft SPEED, Altitude, Pitch Angle and Bank Angle

-Left-hand side is the speedometer. Right-hand side is the altitude meter. On the center is 
  the main display with the artificial horizon, the nose and wings and also the pitch angle is being measured.
  On the bottom, its the Bank angle meter


-part of the GUI was done in NetBeans so that part of the code is long and wierd but just ignore


*screenshot is attached for quick look
